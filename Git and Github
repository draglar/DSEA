When we get started writing a new program, the last thing we want to happen is to lose any of our hard work.
To prevent that terrible possibility from happening, we will save versions of our code on our computer and also save a version of our code on a location on the web
The reason why we store our code on the web is to prevent loss of versions that you may have made on your computer.
In case your hard drive gets corrupted or worse, you lose your laptop, all you need to do is retrieve your work from the web

This is where Version control comes in.
Version control is a management system that manages the changes that you make to the project till the end.
Every time you make a change to your project snapshots are taken by the version control system.
Examples of version control systems.
  * Git
  * GNU arch
  * Fossil
  * DCVS and many more proprietary and open souce version control systems

> Setting up git
>>Installing git
For Windows users:
 ~Use the installer at https://gitforwindows.org/

>> Usage 
A Git repository is contained in a .git directory, which holds the revision history and other metadata.
 ~Initialize a repository
   git init
 ~Clone an existing repository
   git clone repository
 ~Add working tree changes to the index
   git add pathspec
 ~Remove changes from the index
   git reset pathspec
 ~Show changes to be committed, unstaged changes and untracked files
   git status
 ~Committing changes
   The git commit command records the staged changes to the repository
     -m – supply the commit message as an argument, instead of composing it in your default text editor
     -a – automatically stage files that have been modified or deleted (does not add untracked files)
     --amend – redo the last commit, amending the commit message or the committed files
