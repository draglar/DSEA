When we get started writing a new program, the last thing we want to happen is to lose any of our hard work.
To prevent that terrible possibility from happening, we will save versions of our code on our computer and also save a version of our code on a location on the web
The reason why we store our code on the web is to prevent loss of versions that you may have made on your computer.
In case your hard drive gets corrupted or worse, you lose your laptop, all you need to do is retrieve your work from the web

This is where Version control comes in.
Version control is a management system that manages the changes that you make to the project till the end.
Every time you make a change to your project snapshots are taken by the version control system.
Examples of version control systems.
  * Git
  * GNU arch
  * Fossil
  * DCVS and many more proprietary and open souce version control systems
